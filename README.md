The first team deliverable is worth 5 points and is due in Week 7. Teams will have short (15 minute) meetings with the TA where you will
demonstrate that:
• your team has registered your project on github COMPLETE
• everyone in the group has used a calendaring system of their choice to create
a .ics event file and has looked at the content of that file with a text editor such (such as vim or textedit). “Reverse engineering” .ics files can offer significant insight.
• your team has functioning code, no matter how minimal: You must demonstrate code that generates a .ics file for a simple, single occurrence event such as: Study for exam, 1pm-2pm HST, 12 August 2015, in Hamilton Library. You must then demonstrate that the calendar program of your choice (say, google calendar) successfully reads and processes the .ics files you generate.
• your system must allow the use of the “geographic position” field described in section 3.8.1.6 of the RFC. Events are not required to use the field, but if the information is provided by the user, your system must support it by putting it into the event file.
• Your systems must also implement the “classification” field as described in section 3.8.1.3 of the RFC. Events are not required to use the field, but if the
￼
information is provided by the user, your system must support it by putting
it into the event file
• In the real-world, your code would be embedded in a larger calendaring
system, so don’t worry much about a user interface. In fact, to create .ics files your user interface can be command line or simple drop-down menus.
