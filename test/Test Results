Test Plan:
  - Tests 1-3 test that the CLASS fields print correctly, also they check the UTC timezone and sort by start date.
  - Tests 4-9 check the different timezones, and also should have an order by start date.
  - Test 10 checks to see if the sorting checks the time if the date is the same.
  - The expected order is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... OR 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 depending on how we are sorting.

Notes:
  - All fields have successfully printed out thus far.
  - When trying to pull from pre-existing folder, error is thrown on my Windows 8 machine.
  - Program can specify that it writes files to a pre-existing 'OurCalendarEvents' folder on the user's Desktop.
  - .ics files have an issue where the timezone is not recognized by Lightning. 
    Not sure if other calendaring programs are having this issue.
  - When attempting to pull a pre-existing file, error is thrown. Bit buggy at the moment?
  - These tests were done without the Great Circle Distance algorithm, but it shouldn't make much of a difference at the moment.
    When the algorithm is finalized with the program, we can just compare the computed values to the expected ones.
