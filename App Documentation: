File Structure:
	ICalendar.java holds the JavaFX user interface.
	EventCreator.java holds the makeEvent method, which takes in user-given variables. It then converts the variables to the proper format and writes the .ics file.
		Variables defined in the instructions for the first deliverable are:
			1. eventSummary: which is the "title" of the event. ex: "Study for exam"
			2. timeStart: which is the start time of the event. ex: "1pm"
			3. timeEnd: which is the end time of the event. ex: "2pm"
			4. dateStart: the start date of the event, must be given in D/M/Y format. ex: "12 August 2015"
			5. location: the location of the event. ex: "Hamilton Library"
		Optional fields:
			Optional fields are String variables initialized to "".
			They must be handled with an If-Else statement in the makeEvent method. If it remains empty, that line should not be written to the .ics file.
			Optional variables are:
				6. geoPosition: given as a string of a Latitude and Longitude pair separated by a ";". 
				7. classification: a string classification.
				


What we have so far (07/07/15 10am):
	On start, our app opens a window prompting the user to fill out a form of required and optional textfields.
	When they are done, they press the save button.
	Clicking the save button starts the following sequence:
		1.All textfields run through ...getText()
		2. The makeEvent method in the EventCreator class is called, passing all the parameters gathered in step 1.
		3. The makeEvent method writes the file line by line, placing in the appropriate parameter where told to.
		4. makeEvent writes to the console when finished, and then file is saved.




*TO-DO:
	Convert timeStart and dateStart into the .ics file format for the DTSTART line. (Similar must be done for DTEND line).
		.ics file format lumps the date and time together in one chain like:
			DTSTART; TZID=Pacific/Honolulu:20150705T091500
			
			^the format is "TIMEZONE: YEAR + MONTH + DAY + T + STARTTIME"
			follow similar format for DTEND.
